<h3>Shaders and Optifine</h3>
<p class="alert alert-warning">Shaders and Optifine are not officially supported. Use at your own risk.</p>
<p>That being said, use the absolutely latest version of Optifine. I recommend Complementary shaders in compatibility
    mode.</p>

    <li>If Immersive Engineering is crashing when loading into a map with shaders, try loading into an empty world
        first.</li>
    <li>Again, this is not officially supported, and is only posted in the hopes that it may be of help, but with
        absolutely no guarantee. We are not responsible if your world breaks, your computer catches fire, or your dog
        escapes. You have been warned.</li>
