<p>If you are trying to autocraft in refined storage with an item that doesn't get used, eg. (mystical agriculture
    infusion crystal, buckets, immersive engineering wire cutters ect..) you will run into problems with refined storage
    wanting a new item for each use.
    To overcome this, it is recommended you use an rftools crafter.</p>
<h5 class="alert alert-info">Warning about infinite storage and NBT limit</h5>
<p>There is a hard limit coded into Minecraft for the amount of data, or NBT, that can be sent. When using an infinite
    disk with refined storage, you can easily hit that threshold. Too much NBT in your RS system can lead to
    crashes/world corruption, as opening any grid from refined storage scans the contents of the entire system.</p>
<p>Items such as cobblestone do not have a lot of NBT, and the amount of cobble is mostly irrelevant. Items that carry a
    lot of NBT would be things like,
    enchanted gear with durability or bees in jars in a dank in a bag of yurting ect...</p>

<p>Keep things like that OUT of your RS system for a smoother ride</p>
