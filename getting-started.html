<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Are you new to minecraft, modded, or just need some help getting started? Here you will find some tips getting
    started in modded.</p>
<p>In order to get started in modded minecraft, you will need a few things. A legit official minecraft account, launcher
    that will be able to load mods, and more than 12gb of ram on your pc.</p>
<p>Three of the most common ones are curseforge, gdlauncher and multimc. Once you have a launcher downloaded, you can go
    ahead and search for the modpack of your choice within the launcher and install them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lauchers come with their own version of Java</li>
    <li>Some launchers work better than others</li>
    <li>Ram will need to be adjusted within the laucher no matter which you use</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the modpack installed you will need to adjust the amount of ram your computer gives to minecraft. We
    recommend a minimum 8gb and you should really have enought to dedicate 10gb with atleast 2gb left over for windows.
    Additionally, head on over to <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/troubleshooting/java/">our java page</a> where we
    have some
    custom java arguements that can help with performance while playing.
</p>
<p>Depending on your launcher, you can install and use java11. (gdlauncher and multimc allows this) this can also help
    with performance. We also have recommended arguments for java11 on <a
        href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/troubleshooting/java/">our java page</a></p>

<p class="text-warning bg-primary p-3">Curseforge is changing the way it allows access to its 'software'. Because of
    this, gdlauncher and MultiMC may become unavailable to the public in the upcomming months. Please consider this when
    choosing a launcher.</p>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
<p>The very first thing you need to know about modded is JEI (just enough items). JEI is kind of like your in game
    google for items. You can look up any items by mod, description or tooltip. You can also see how the item is made
    and what other recipies the item is used in.</p>
<h5>Here is a spotlight on JEI to help get you started:</h5>

<p>Once in game, you will get a few items, the first being the Akashic Tome. This tome contains books from some of the
    popular mods (where available) that will help guide you through them. Some mods use the advancements tab to help
    with progression (eg. Twilight Forest). Also, there is a quest book/system. You can access it by opening your
    inventory and clicking the book icon in the top left of your screen.</p>
