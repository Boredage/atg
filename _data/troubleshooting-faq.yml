- question: My server is crashing with a server hang detected watchdog error
  answer: This is common on fresh worlds, or busy worlds when somebody does a significant action that takes the server longer than 60 seconds to process. Change max-tick-time in server.properties to 600000 (10 minutes) as a first step in getting past this. If crashes persist (they'll be a different error or take 10 minutes) then pastebin logs for help.

- question: I crash with error 0!
  answer: This is a local environment issue. Usernames with spaces and/or incorrect java installed or set in the path/launcher youre using, frequently cause this. Get a good launcher that lets you install forge easily (like MultiMC), and make sure thats installed properly. Read the logs, and pastebin them for help if youre still broken.
